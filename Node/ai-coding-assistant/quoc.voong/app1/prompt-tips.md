# Prompt Tips

## Write Clear and Descriptive Comments

(Don't) Write the Factorial.

(Do) Create a JavaScript function to calculate the factorial of a number. The function should use recursion and handle edge cases like 0 and 1.

## Break Down Tasks into Smaller Steps

(Don't) Implement Application using Node.js and Express

(Do) Implement Application using Node.js and Express

Actions:
- Set up a new Node.js project.
- Create an Express server.
- Define routes for CRUD operations on blog posts.
- Implement middleware for JSON parsing and error handling.
- Connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- Write tests for the API endpoints.

## Add Example Inputs and Outputs
Write a Function to Return the Square of a Number
- **Input:** 4
- **Output:** 16

## Provide Partial Code for Context

```javascript  
function processData(data) {  
    // TODO: filter data by status
}  
```

## Use Specific Keywords and Constraints
Use *Node.js* and the *csv-parser* library to read a *CSV file* and filter rows based on a column value.

## Task-Action-Guideline Pattern
