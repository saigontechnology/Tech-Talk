# .NET Aspire

## What is .NET Aspire?

.NET Aspire is an opinionated, cloud ready stack for building observable, production ready, distributed applications.â€‹ .NET Aspire is delivered through a collection of NuGet packages that handle specific cloud-native concerns. Cloud-native apps often consist of small, interconnected pieces or microservices rather than a single, monolithic code base. Cloud-native apps generally consume a large number of services, such as databases, messaging, and caching.

## Deployment

.NET Aspire applications are built with cloud-agnostic principles, allowing deployment flexibility across various platforms supporting .NET and containers. Users can adapt the provided guidelines for deployment on other cloud environments or local hosting. The manual deployment process, while feasible, involves exhaustive steps prone to errors. We anticipate users will prefer leveraging CI/CD pipelines and cloud-specific tooling for a more streamlined deployment experience tailored to their chosen infrastructure.
